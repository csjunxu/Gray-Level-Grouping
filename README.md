# Gray-Level-Grouping
## Bachelor of Technology (Undergrad) Project.
Gray Level Grouping (glg.m) helps enhance the contrast of gray-scale images. This method increases the dynamic frequency distribution range to do so. Fast GLG (fglg.m) is a version of GLG that runs faster but produces different result. Other methods like Histogram Equalization (heq.m), Logarithmic Transformation (log.m), Power Law Transformation (pow.m) are also some of the contrast enhancement techniques shown for comparison.
